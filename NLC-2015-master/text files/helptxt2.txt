~~~HELP~~~

Welcome to Nick and Nick's 2015 National Leadership Conference
Game and Simulation competition submission - Sector Shoot-em-up!

The game consits of 11 levels, followed by the boss level. At
the end of each level, you will see a small green circle, which
you must fly through to proceed to the next level.

The player is controlled by the WASD keys (W for up, S for down,
A for left, and D for right) and aimed with the mouse cursor. To
fire simply hold down the left mouse button. 

Your health will be displayed at the bottom left corner, along
with your score achieved thus far in the game. If your health
runs out, you will have to restart the level!

Each enemy is based on a different type of malware, and they
act accordingly. You can read about the real world version of
each enemy type in the "LINKS" section on the main menu.
